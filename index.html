    <h1>OOPS in Java</h1>
    <br>
    <p>OOPs, or Object-Oriented Programming is a programming model or paradigm which
        revolves around the concept of “OBJECTS”. Objects can be considered as real-world
        instances of entities like class, that contain some characteristics and behaviors
        specified in the class template.</p>
<p>In simple language, a class can be considered as the blueprint or template, based on
    which objects can be created. So the Objects are considered the instance of a class,
    and are therefore sometimes called “instances”. The term “characteristics” refers to
    the “what” about the Object, and the term “behavior” refers to the “how” about the
    Object.</p>
<p>For example, if we consider a car, then based on the OOPs model:
    Class = A specific car model, such as Audi A4, BMW I8, Maruti Suzuki Vitara
    Brezza, etc. Object = A specific car of any model, like the car you own
    Characteristics = What is the color of your car? What is the Chassis number of
    your car? etc.
    </p>
    
<p>
    Behavior = How to start the car? How to change the gear of the car? etc.
Characteristics are also known as data, attributes, or properties, and Behaviours are
also known as the functions, procedures or methods, in the programming language.
The concept of “objects” allows the OOPs model to easily access, use and modify the
instance data and methods, interact with other objects, and define methods in
runtime (during the execution of the program). This gives the OOPs model
significance and makes it diverse in its implementation.
In fact, the OOPs model is so popular, that many of the most widely used
programming languages support and use this Object Oriented Programming or OOPs
model, such as Java, C++, Python, C#, etc.
